    <p>I'd like to specifically talk about <strong>Magpie</strong> as it's all about automation. Just like Zapier!</p>    
    <p>A latest trend I've noticed among small businesses is that they've been ignoring email marketing and focusing all their marketing efforts on social media.</p>
    <p>Since <a href="http://www.emailisnotdead.com/" target="_blank">email is not dead</a> and it's still extremely effective, I thought neglecting email is a mistake and wanted to create a product to tackle this issue. Companies are already generating great content on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and on their blog. So, why not remove all the friction for creating a newsletter by collecting their content and sending them to their customers in a beautiful email?</p>

    I quickly created the first <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/169206/magpie_first_mockup.pdf" target="_blank">mockup [PDF]</a> for MVP with Balsamiq, my favorite mockup tool that I've been using for the last 7 years. After talking to 4-5 people about the product (sanity check) and doing some competitor research, I created the lean canvas (which I do for every product I work own).

    I used Python and Django (just like you guys) to develop the app by myself in the weekends for a few months. Having a full-stack engineering background enabled me shipping the product without external help. However, I wanted more polish with the frontend and asked a friend to join me in the project. It has been extremely fun working with numerous web service integrations to automate a boring and inefficient process for businesses. <a href="https://magpie.io/demo/420/" target="_blank">Here's</a> how Zapier's fully automated newsletter would look like.

    <h5>Why Erinc <span style="color: #ff4a00; font-size: 25px;">â™¥</span> Zapier would be a great fit?</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Integrations and automations fascinate me. Led products at one of the largest integration SaaS companies (<strong>Hootsuite</strong>). </li>
        <li>I truly believe that Zapier is just getting started and it will fundamentally impact global business productivity. Being part of this shift would be an amazing opportunity.</li>
