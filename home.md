    A quick update after <strong>10 years</strong>: I still don't have a good definition of home.

I often ponder the concept of "home." The more I reflect on it, the more intricate it becomes, especially for individuals like me who were born in one place, lived in different locations, and are constantly on the move.

Is home defined by:

* Your place of birth?
* Your eventual place of death?
* Where your family resides?
* Where you pay your taxes?
* Your parents' birthplace?
* Where you've spent the majority of your life?
* Your most recent place of residence?
* Where you desire to spend the majority of your time?
* Where you have loved the most?
* Where you've formed the strongest connections with people?
* Where most of your friends live?
* Where you have the most/best memories?
* Where you've experienced the most happiness?

Traveling and living all over the world have taught me that home is not a physical location. It's wherever I feel happy and at peace, whether that's in a specific place or with certain people.

Recently, I watched a TED talk entitled "Where is Home?" and was captivated by the presenter's definition of home:

"Home is less to do with a piece of soil than a piece of soul."

"Home is a work in progress."

"Where you come from now is much less important than where you're going."

I highly recommend this touching, poetic TED talk by Pico Iyer:
